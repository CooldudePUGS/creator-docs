If you're particularly keen with Udon, you might've noticed that it is possible to build a system in your world that can moderate users in various ways, such as keeping misbehaving visitors out of areas of the map, or removing their ability to interact with others in the world entirely. There exist several community-created prefabs as well, if you don't want to build your own.

**As long as your implementation is fair, safe, and follows our rules below, you may use a system like this in your own world.**

These guidelines are currently only accessible via a direct link as they are not final, but we link them to users when they ask about it.

## Guidelines
If you want to apply moderation effects to a user in your world using Udon, you **must** follow these guidelines.

1. **Tell everyone that enters your world that you have rules, and that you will apply moderation effects if they break them.** You must list your rules at or near the entrance of your world, or have them otherwise easily accessible and visible.
2. **Tell everyone that is moderated by your system what effects have been applied and why.** For example, if you teleport a user off the dance floor and lock them out for bad language, you might deliver this message like so: "You have been kicked off the dance floor for: bad language". This must be done both in-world (as in, something easily readable by a user) and in the VRChat logs.
3. **If you moderate someone, it MUST be because of something they did in this instance.** Apply your moderation effects ONLY as the result of specific behaviors personally witnessed in the current instance of the world. **In other words, you cannot have a user blacklist or whitelist.** This includes (but is not limited to) creating a list based off someone's name or player properties.

You may not:

1. **Change the user's avatar.**
2. **Intentionally crash the user.** Doing so will cause your account to be moderated by the VRChat Trust and Safety Team.
3. **Automatically apply moderation effects to any user** based on past behavior or any of their personal characteristics. Again, **this means you cannot have a user blacklist or whitelist.** This includes creating a blacklist or whitelist based off someone's name or player properties.

If we find your usage of user-created moderation tools in Udon to be inappropriate, we may remove content or moderate your account until the issues are addressed. This judgement will be made at our discretion.
